# K L I Y O 

**KLIYO** is a Discord Bot that allows server visitors to explore a Machine Learning Playground created by **Sharbel**. KLIYO allows users to experience Machine Learning in its different models and uses. 

By adding KLIYO to your Discord Server, you will get the chance to experience hands-on interaction with Machine Learning Models such as Linear Regression and Logistic Regression. In addition, you can try to chat with KLIYO thanks to a Deep Neural Network made of 8 Layers that KLIYO is set up with.  

KLIYO allows users to:
* Learn about different Machine Learning Models (Linear Regression, Logistic Regression) and how they are implemented as solutions to real-life problems!  
* Learn about more advanced Machine Learning Models such as Neural Networks and use them to predict the results of a very fun everyday task.  
* Interact with the models by giving them inputs and checking out their unique outputs!  
* Check the story behind certain problems and how a Machine Learning Model can fix them.  
* Most importantly, KLIYO can provide you with Machine Learning jokes he finds "funny" :p  

## Important Notes  
* All the Machine Learning Models are built **manually** and without the use of Machine Learning libraries (except for the neural networks).
* Just like any Machine Learning Application, the accuracy of the models used is not 100% and the model could give you an inaccurate answer or an answer you did not except, so please, be patient with KLIYO and have fun!

## TRY KLIYO RIGHT NOW :space_invader:!  
Follow the below steps to get KLIYO up and running:
* Add Kliyo to your Discord Server using the link below &darr;  
https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=996470449171091467&permissions=534723947584&scope=bot  
* Once KLIYO joins your server, type ```-help``` in the chat and enjoy!  

## KLIYO in action!  

Here is what the ```-help``` command does:

Moreover, you can choose the Machine Learning Model you want from the list of models by typing ```-models``` in the chat. For example, here they chose model #2 by typing ```2``` in the chat and then typing ```test``` to test it!
